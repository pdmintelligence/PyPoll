#Election Summary: The script created in this module can be used to analyze and audit election results in different state contexts. The code as written pulls information from county level locations; however, this can be modified to municipal districts or other such categories as needed. Similarly, the script can be modified such that rather than analyzing election results at the county level, it is rendered at the federal or state level (IE: replace the column header 'County' with the header of 'State').
